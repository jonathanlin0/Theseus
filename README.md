### Background Information

Our game follows the story of Theseus. In the Greek myth, fourteen-year-old Theseus was chosen by King Minos to be an annual sacrifice to the Minotaur, an abomination of a human with a bullâ€™s head that was imprisoned in a labyrinth under Crete. The intricate labyrinth was constructed by Deadalus, a master engineer who was also responsible for the creation of the Minotaur. Rather than accepting his fate, Theseus, with the guidance of princess Ariadne, sought and defeated the Minotaur, cementing his position in Greek mythology as a warrior legend.

### Gameplay

The player plays as Theseus in his journey of traveling through the labyrinth to kill the Minotaur. To help gamify this experience, we added enemies (mythological Greek creatures, typical gaming monsters, etc) that the player faces in the mazes throughout the game.
